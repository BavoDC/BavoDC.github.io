<p>I am a data scientist and a statistician, who tries to combine the best of two worlds. I have over <script>document.write(age);</script> years of experience and my area of expertise lies in the construction and validation of predictive models. I also have experience in other research areas, such as clustering and assessing the agreement or reliability of repeated measurements. Further, I am proficient in and have a passion for programming (especially in R). I love to immerse myself in new research projects, which require me to solve complex problems and to analyze the data thoroughly. Tackling new, unfamiliar challenges is something I look forward to as it allows me to grow and develop new knowledge and new skills.</p>

<p>I did my PhD in Actuarial Science at the KU Leuven, under the supervision of professor dr <a href="https://katrienantonio.github.io/" target="_blank">Katrien Antonio</a>. My research focused on the development and evaluation of predictive modeling techniques within actuarial science. In my research, I assessed the performance of both statistical and machine learning methods. Another part of my research focused on the development of fraud detection models using social network features. Here, I examined both the methodological and practical part. If you want to read my PhD thesis, you can do so by clicking on this <a href="./Thesis/DoctoralThesis_BavoDCCampo.pdf">link</a>.</p>

<p>Before my PhD, I worked as a biostatistian in the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (<a href="https://www.iotagroup.org/">IOTA</a>) group and I stayed connected to biomedical research throughout my whole career. In the IOTA group, I was part of an interdisciplinary
team of researchers connected to UZ Leuven and KU Leuven. I worked on numerous projects, which provided me with a firm and solid
basis in biostatistics. Furthermore, my main research projects focused on the development and validation of
clinical prediction models.</p>

        I was part of the statistical unit of the IOTA group. I conducted the statistical analyses, documented, presented and discussed the results with the multidisciplinary team. Additionally, I took responsibility for managing and encrypting the databases as well as for developing (statistical) software to facilitate our research. I worked on numerous projects, which can best be summarized as follows:
        <ul max-width="70px">

              <li>evaluation and (external) validation of clinical prediction models.</li>

<h1 id="software">Software</h1>
<p>You can find a selected set of my software projects on my <a href="https://github.com/BavoDC" target="_blank">Github page</a>. Of these, two are published on CRAN. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me! I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<h2 id="cran-packages">CRAN packages</h2>

<h3 id="calibrationcurves"><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=CalibrationCurves" target="blank">CalibrationCurves</a></h3>
<p>With the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CalibrationCurves</code> package, you can generate (generalized) calibration curves, which are essential for evaluating the calibration performance of predictive models. In addition, it also computes a comprehensive range of statistics to assess the predictive performance of your model. As such, this package provides the necessary tools to evaluate the performance of your predictive model.</p>

<p>Detailed information as well as a tutorial can be found on the package’s <a href="https://bavodc.github.io/websiteCalibrationCurves/" target="blank">website</a>.</p>

<h4 id="key-features">Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Generate calibration plots easily (both with base R and <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/">ggplot</a>).</li>
  <li>Assess model performance with various calibration and discrimination metrics.</li>
  <li>Supports both binary and continuous outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="actuare"><a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=actuaRE" target="blank">actuaRE</a></h2>
<p>Using this package, you can fit a random effects model using either the hierarchical credibility model, a combination of the hierarchical credibility model with a generalized linear model or a Tweedie generalized linear mixed model.</p>

<p>As the CalibrationCurves package, this package also has its own dedicated <a href="https://bavodc.github.io/websiteactuaRE/">website</a> with a tutorial and comprehensive overview of the package’s functionality.</p>

<h3 id="key-features-1">Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Fit a random effects model with nested random effect using three different estimation methods.</li>
  <li>Obtain a comprehensive overview of the properties of the fitted model.</li>
  <li>Verify whether a fitted model has the balance property (i.e., the sum of the predicted values equals the sum of actual observations).</li>
  <li>Regain the balance property by adjusting the intercept term.</li>
  <li>Analyze and visualize the random effect predictions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am committed to continuously improving these packages and adding new features based on user feedback and the latest research developments. Your input is invaluable, and I welcome any questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas.</p>
