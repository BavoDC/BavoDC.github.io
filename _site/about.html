<p>Hi there, thank you for visiting my page! I am a statistician and a data scientist, who tries to combine the best of two worlds. I strongly believe that a combination of statistics and data science allows us to gain more insight in the data at hand and results in better performing models with a higher predictive accuracy. Some may know me as Bavo De Cock. I recently changed and publish using the surname Campo to honor my mother who was also active in academia. She, together with my father, still serve as a big inspiration to me.</p>

<p>I originally started working as a biostatistical researcher in the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group. I combined this full-time job with a MSc in Statistics. This allowed me to directly apply the concepts that I learned to the research I was working on at the time. Here I discovered my passion for performing research, programming and mathematics. I am forever grateful to all members of the IOTA team. They provided me with a sound and solid basis of statistical methodology and research.</p>

<p>Given my growing interest in mathematics, I was drawn to actuarial science. I was fascinated by the rigorous use of mathematics, statistics and machine learning in this field. Thanks to the guidance of my promotor, professor dr. Katrien Antonio, my hereto related knowledge and skills have increased tremendously over the past years. I know now that I absolutely love the challenges that predictive modeling brings as well as the research related to it.</p>

<p>Next to research, I also love to do sports. Hiking is one of my favorite sports, since it also involves traveling. I love to explore new areas, meet new people and to take a moment to enjoy a breathtaking view on top of a mountain. At the same time, I enjoy quiet activities. I love to learn new things and to deepen my understanding of unfamiliar subjects. In particular about medicine. Sadly, the older we get, the more we are confronted with the limitations of human life. Learning about medicine helps me to better understand some of the things that happen in reality, just as statistics and data science do.</p>
