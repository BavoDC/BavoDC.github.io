<p>I was recently invited to speak on the <em>Data Skeptic</em> podcast about my research on fraud detection. It was a great experience, complete with a few pre-recording jitters,
  where I got to discuss our <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13385-024-00399-z">paper</a> on <strong>simulating network-based insurance fraud data</strong>.</p>

<p>We developed a simulation engine that mimics the characteristics of real-world insurance fraud network data. It allows researchers to experiment with different fraud patterns,
  levels of class imbalance, and network structures - all without relying on sensitive or hard-to-access data. This enables a more robust development and evaluation of fraud detection
   techniques.
</p>

The conversation covered a lot of ground, but two questions stuck with me. I wish I had answered them better. So here is a quick follow-up:
<h3>1. What is Actuarial Science and what career options are there?</h3>
<p>Actuarial science applies mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to assess risk, mostly in insurance, pensions, and finance. Actuaries work on product design, pricing, and
  risk management, and increasingly also in data science. Career paths include roles in insurance, consulting and tech-driven analytics.
</p>

<h3>2. What are neighborhood and fraud-score based features?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Neighborhood-based features: describe the network structure, e.g. how connected a claim is to known fraudsters.</li>
  <li>Fraud-score based features: capture the predicted fraud risk of a node and its surroundings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, during the episode I briefly touched on class imbalance and its implications for logistic regression. I wanted to share some excellent references I have come across:</p>
