I am a data scientist and a statistician, who tries to combine the best of two worlds. I have over <script>document.write(age);</script> years of experience and my area of expertise lies in the construction and validation of predictive models. I also have experience in other research areas, such as clustering and assessing the agreement or reliability of repeated measurements. Further, I am proficient in and have a passion for programming (especially in R). I love to immerse myself in new research projects, which require me to solve complex problems and to analyze the data thoroughly. Tackling new, unfamiliar challenges is something I look forward to as it allows me to grow and develop new knowledge and new skills.

I did my PhD in Actuarial Science at the KU Leuven, under the supervision of professor dr [Katrien Antonio](https://katrienantonio.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. My research focused on the development and evaluation of predictive modeling techniques within actuarial science. In my research, I assessed the performance of both statistical and machine learning methods. Another part of my research focused on the development of fraud detection models using social network features. Here, I examined both the methodological and practical part. If you want to read my PhD thesis, you can do so by clicking on this [link](./Thesis/DoctoralThesis_BavoDCCampo.pdf).

Before my PhD, I worked as a biostatistian in the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis ([IOTA](https://www.iotagroup.org/)) group and I stayed connected to biomedical research throughout my whole career. In the IOTA group, I was part of an interdisciplinary
team of researchers connected to UZ Leuven and KU Leuven. I worked on numerous projects, which provided me with a firm and solid
basis in biostatistics. Furthermore, my main research projects focused on the development and validation of
clinical prediction models.

# Software
You can find a selected set of my software projects on my [Github page](https://github.com/BavoDC){:target="_blank"}. Of these, two are published on CRAN. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me! I look forward to hearing from you.

## CRAN packages

### [CalibrationCurves](https://cran.r-project.org/package=CalibrationCurves){:target="blank"}
With the `CalibrationCurves` package, you can generate (generalized) calibration curves, which are essential for evaluating the calibration performance of predictive models. In addition, it also computes a comprehensive range of statistics to assess the predictive performance of your model. As such, this package provides the necessary tools to evaluate the performance of your predictive model.

Detailed information as well as a tutorial can be found on the package's [website](https://bavodc.github.io/websiteCalibrationCurves/){:target="blank"}.

#### Key Features:
- Generate calibration plots easily (both with base R and [ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)).
- Assess model performance with various calibration and discrimination metrics.
- Supports both binary and continuous outcomes.

## [actuaRE](https://cran.r-project.org/package=actuaRE){:target="blank"}
Using this package, you can fit a random effects model using either the hierarchical credibility model, a combination of the hierarchical credibility model with a generalized linear model or a Tweedie generalized linear mixed model.

As the CalibrationCurves package, this package also has its own dedicated [website](https://bavodc.github.io/websiteactuaRE/) with a tutorial and comprehensive overview of the package's functionality.

### Key Features:
- Fit a random effects model with nested random effect using three different estimation methods.
- Obtain a comprehensive overview of the properties of the fitted model.
- Verify whether a fitted model has the balance property (i.e., the sum of the predicted values equals the sum of actual observations).
- Regain the balance property by adjusting the intercept term.
- Analyze and visualize the random effect predictions.

I am committed to continuously improving these packages and adding new features based on user feedback and the latest research developments. Your input is invaluable, and I welcome any questions, suggestions, or collaboration ideas.
