I am a data scientist and a statistician, who tries to combine the best of two worlds. I have over 7 years of experience and my area of expertise lies in the construction and validation of predictive models. I also have experience in other research areas, such as clustering and assessing the agreement or reliability of repeated measurements. Further, I am proficient in and have a passion for programming (especially in R). I love to immerse myself in new research projects, which require me to solve complex problems and to analyze the data thoroughly. Tackling new, unfamiliar challenges is something I look forward to as it allows me to grow and develop new knowledge and new skills.

Currently I am doing my PhD in Actuarial Science at the KU Leuven, under the supervision of professor dr [Katrien Antonio](https://katrienantonio.github.io/){:target="_blank"}. My research focuses on the development and evaluation of predictive modeling techniques within actuarial science. In my research, I assess the performance of both statistical and machine learning methods. Another part of my research focuses on the development of fraud detection models using social network features. Here, I examine both the methodological and practical part.

        My PhD was part of a collaboration between the KU Leuven and a Belgian insurance company. I took responsibility for translating the insurance company's research question into an analysis plan as well as for planning, organizing, programming, executing and analyzing the research. Further, I communicated the research findings in a clear and concise way to the company at regular intervals. The main projects that I worked on are:
        <ul max-width=70px>
          <li>workers' compensation insurance:
            <ol class="square">
              <li>constructed an algorithm to reduce hierarchically structured categorical variables to their essence;</li>
              <li>developed a workflow for the construction and validation of prediction models when both subject-specific and hierarchically structured categorical variables are available. </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>fraud detection:
            <ol class="square">
              <li>development of a simulation engine to develop and to evaluate insurance fraud detection strategies.</li>

        I was part of the statistical unit of the IOTA group. I conducted the statistical analyses, documented, presented and discussed the results with the multidisciplinary team. Additionally, I took responsibility for managing and encrypting the databases as well as for developing (statistical) software to facilitate our research.

# Books
Over the years, I have acquired a substantial amount of knowledge on programming and data analysis. Just as the professors, everyone at stackoverflow and countless others, I want to transfer this accumulated knowledge to help others. Hereto, I helped rewrite and adjust some of the books of professor dr [Katrien Antonio](https://katrienantonio.github.io/){:target="_blank"}:
* [Introduction to R](./intro-R-book_RawFiles){:target="_blank"}
* [Loss Models](./Loss-Models){:target="_blank"}
