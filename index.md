I am a doctoral researcher at the Department of Accountancy, Finance and Insurance at the Faculty of Economics and Business at KU Leuven, under the supervision of professor dr [Katrien Antonio](https://katrienantonio.github.io/). My research focuses on the development and evaluation of predictive modeling techniques within actuarial science. In my research, I examine both statistical and machine learning methods. Further, I also examine how fraud detection models can be built using social network features. Here, I focus on both the methodological and practical part.
